"""Testing Table of Contents support as requested by user leboni

User leboni forwarded a docx file, `zen_of_python.docx` with Table of Contents.
Addressing issue

`KeyError: '{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships}id'`

When attempting to extract content from such documents.

Two types of links in docx files. Internal links look like actual hyperlinks without
an href.

    <w:hyperlink w:anchor="_Toc48296956" w:history="1">
        <w:r w:rsidRPr="00810578">
            <w:rPr>
                <w:rStyle w:val="Hyperlink"/>
                <w:noProof/>
            </w:rPr>
            <w:t>Beautiful is better than ugly.</w:t>
